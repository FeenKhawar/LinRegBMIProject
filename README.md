  This program and project examines the effect of multiple individual characteristics on one's Body Mass Index (BMI) and how the overall BMI of America changed between 2019 - 2023. I read the data files I wanted to examine from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and cleaned them accordingly. Then, I read an Excel file containing information on the unemployment rates of all the states and merged it with the BRFSS datasets of the other years. Finally, I run a few plots and graphs on it as well as linear regressions and interpret the results. A full paper is available which shows the background, information, methods, results, interpretations, and shortcomings of my project. 
  The runtime for the program is about 5 minutes. 70-85% of this runtime is simply the program reading the data from its file, as the file type (XPT) and nature of the file require an extended amount of time to read and process through. 
  To view my paper (which is in PDF form), I suggest a PDF reader. I personally use "vscode-pdf" from tomoki1207. 
  Run the "Main.py" file to run all my code and files in order.
