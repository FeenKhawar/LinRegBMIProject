  This program and project is about examining the effect of multiple individual characteristics on one's 
Body Mass Index (BMI). Additionally, seeing how the overall BMI of America was changed between 2019 - 2023.
I read the data files I want to examine from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)
and clean it accordingly. Then, I read a excel file containing information on the unemployment rates of all
the states and get the years 2019 - 2023 and merge it with the BRFSS datasets of the other years. Then I run
a few plots and graphs on it as well as linear regressions and interpret the results. A full paper is available 
which shows the background, information, methods, results, interpretations, and shortcomings of my project.
  The runtime for thi program is about 4-6 minutes. 70-85% of this runtime is simply the program reading the data
from its file, as the file type (XPT) and nature of the file requires an extended amount of time to read and 
process through. 
To view my paper (which is in a pdf form), I suggest a pdf reader. I personally use "vscode-pdf" from tomoki1207.
